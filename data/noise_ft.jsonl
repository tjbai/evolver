The second part covers the Trojan War to the death of Alexander the Great. The third part covers the period to about 60 BC.

There is also a Greek inscription in the collection of the Agyrium (Inscriptiones Graecae XIV, 588) about the tombstone of one \"Diodorus, the son of Apollonius\". (This may be a different person).

Counts of Flanders were always concerned with hunting and preserving their hunting grounds. For that reason many were called foresters. The last count was Francis II. After 1795 Flanders no longer existed as a county. Charles V proclaimed the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 eternally uniting Flanders with the other lordships of the Low Countries in a personal union.

While working there, Franklin secretly wrote articles for the newspaper and labelled them as being by \"Mrs. Silence Dogood\".
